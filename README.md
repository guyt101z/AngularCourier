AngularCourier
==============
### Welcome! let me try to explain a little. 

this is, the Same project about a courier but this time made entirely as a single page apliccation  using angular.js (as a framework) entirely for its construction.and using an API to bring up the data than feeds the aplication.

this project wont display anything unless u have it set up to make request to the correct API, you can find it [here:](https://github.com/torreta/CourierAppAPI)

you wont need anithing else than your browser but....
theres afew conditions you shoud know...

> ## conditions:
>  1. Clone the git project, or download it, however you want 
>  2. Get into the project folder via command terminal (did you unzip it, right?)
>  3. to open it in your browser you need CORS activated (Cross-origin resource sharing)
>  4. you need to have the API running and ready to attend requests
>  5. you need to change BASE_URL to  point out the place where the API is accepting request
>  6. everithing is working, its ugly, but its working, if you need some guidance, please, dont hesitate on contacting me, to get you around the basics.
>  7. i might be updating this soon, so please have patience im still learning.
>  8. have fun! XD
